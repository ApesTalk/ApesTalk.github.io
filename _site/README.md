# Introduce

鸟活着时，吃蚂蚁，
鸟死后，蚂蚁吃鸟。
一棵树可以制成一百万根火柴，
烧光一百万棵树只需一根火柴。
活着，低调做人。

# Vno - Jekyll

[Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll) is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a port of my Ghost theme [vno](https://github.com/onevcat/vno), which is originally developed from [Dale Anthony's Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/uno).
